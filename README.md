# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


TODO:
- my approach, externalize and built the reusable elements with chakra ui to make development easier, faster, readable and maintainable, and also aid easier refactoring
- made it very responsive, by even considering very large devices of width over 2000px
- lighthouse
- i externalized any data, so as to ensure easy integration
- proper documentation, for theme, and component, using design patterns
- why use vite
